Hello World! 🌍
**My name is Brenda Leyva and I am a computer science student at UIC!**

I am a student who is inspired to become a Cybersecurity Specialist or Network Engineering Support individual. With prior experience through events, (Hackathons and CTF’s) I am interested in making an impact on and off campus!
